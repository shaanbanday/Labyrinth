# Labyrinth
A computer maze game based on the titular 1986 board game.
This is a game coded in Java™ using the Eclipse IDE and is targeted towards a 5-10 age demographic. The goal of the game is for the user to get their character to 
cross the finish line by moving it around with the arrow keys or the WASD keys. After the user-controlled character traverses the finish line, 
located at the end of the maze, they win the game. However, there are deadly walls in the maze that the user cannot pass nor touch. Furthermore, 
there is a move counter, which incrementally decreases after each key-press. Incidentally, the user must be closely attentive to make sure they 
do not make an erroneous blunder. When the user hits any of the obstructing walls or runs out of moves — whichever comes first — the game is 
subsequently lost. 
There are also three separate and distinct levels, each with an added amount of difficulty. Level 1 is trivial since there are not many walls, and
there are 750 moves available for the user. Contrastingly, Level 2 has many more walls while also only having 700 key-presses available. Lastly, 
Level 3 has the most number of walls and the least number of moves accessible by the user.
